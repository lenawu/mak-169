== Purpose

    To provide a step-by-step tutorial for updating the front-end of the application.
    
== The Terminal

    1.  Before anything make sure you have the right version of rails but entering this command:
        "rvm use 2.2.2@mak_rails"
    2. Open a second Terminal for git updates
    3. Use "git pull"   to make sure you have all the latest updates locally.
    4. To view what's going on with what you're updating run this command and open the address that pops up.
        "rails s -p $PORT -b $IP" in the terminal where you set your version of rails.

== Modifying the Website and Git
    
    1. The html files are located in:
        app > views > info
    2. After modifying what you want be sure to commit your changes:
        "git add -A"  Adds your changes to the magic package you're sending
        "git commit -a -m '[what you're uploading]'" Gets the package ready for deliver
    3.  After committing, which is hard :'(, you just push to upload your changes.
        "git push origin master" adds your changes to github
        "git push heroku master" uploads your changes to the website!
